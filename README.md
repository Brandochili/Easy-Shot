# Easy-Shot
An open-sourced laser &amp; LiDAR distance measure for lawn bowling.

The Easy-Shot is a measuring device made to increase the physical accessibility of the sport of lawn bowling for aging members. This project research took place at the Regina Lawn Bowling Club. The device uses an ESP32 microcontroller, two IPS displays, two LiDAR sensors, a lithium-ion battery, a green laser line, three buttons, woodworking and 3D printing, to create a device that can take a distance measurement between a bowl and a jack to determine the shot bowl. This project is open-sourced and includes build plans, 3D print files, a purchasing list, a wiring diagram and the code.
